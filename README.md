We're thrilled to have you here and excited to see what you'll bring to our community! The [Discussions](https://github.com/HeroImaging/Community/discussions) forum is the perfect place to connect with the development team and other users to share your work, ask questions, and collaborate on new ideas. Don't be shy - introduce yourself and jump right in!

We also encourage you to report any bugs or issues you encounter in the [Issues](https://github.com/HeroImaging/Community/issues) section. Your feedback helps us improve and make our software even better.

And hey, if you're curious about how our software works, we've got you covered! Check out our [demo videos](https://www.youtube.com/@HeroImaging) posted on YouTube. You can find the workflows from these videos in this repository as well, so you can try things for yourself.
